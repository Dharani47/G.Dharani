    <p style="text-align: justify;"> The history of Indian Freedom Struggle would be incomplete without mentioning the contributions of women.</em4>
        The sacrifice made by the women of India will occupy the foremost place.
        They fought with true spirit and undaunted courage and faced various tortures, exploitations and hardships to earn us freedom.
        When most of the men freedom fighters were in prison the women came forward and took charge of the struggle.
        The list of great women whose names have gone down in history of dedication and undying devotion to the service of Indiais a long one.
        We see few of them.</p>
